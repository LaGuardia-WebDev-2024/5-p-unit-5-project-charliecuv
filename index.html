  dear xxx<br>

  <br>you are formally invited to <span class="wow">evernight tea party</span> a special tea party hosted only<br>
  one every season and only <em>very special</em> bugs and fae are invited!<br>

  <br>you must bring tea and cakes or any other snack and neccesities to this tea party<br>

  or else you are <span class="wow">not</span> allowed in, so please spare some cups and food<br>

  <br> clothes must be purple or blue and white is allowed only as an accent. remember every fae<br>
  must be on their best behavior or else you shall be banished for life!<br>

  <br> to find this place follow the flowers that jingle like bells and the path of white roses<br>
  to where flowers glow and give a toll to the fountain of one finger before throwing<br>
  the letter in and stating your reason for being there. once your done jump in!

  <br>and remember you can't leave unless you have a guest to sacrifice
